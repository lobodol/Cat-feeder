## 1. Introduction
This project provides Arduino code of an automatic cat feeder.
The mecanism is about a Achrimed screw done with Fimo clay.
The motor used is a DC motor controlled by a driver circuit (based on a TC4428 and an IRF540).

A manual distribution can be done with a pushbutton trigerring an external interrupt.
